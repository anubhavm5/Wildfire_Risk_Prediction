🔥 WildFire Risk Prediction

WildFire Risk Prediction is a Machine Learning based project that predicts the probability of wildfire risk for a given location using environmental and weather conditions. The project also includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard with a live map interface where users can select a city/country, view coordinates, enter weather parameters, and instantly get the wildfire risk probability.

This system helps in understanding wildfire-prone conditions and can be useful for early awareness, monitoring, and decision-making.

🚀 Key Features

📍 Location-based input (City & Country) with automatic geocoding
🗺️ Interactive map visualization using Folium

🌦️ Weather condition inputs:

Temperature
Humidity
Wind Speed
Rainfall

🌳 Vegetation/Land cover selection:

Forest, Grassland, Cropland, Urban, Barren
🔮 ML model prediction with risk probability output

✅ Risk classification as:

Low Risk
Moderate Risk
High Risk

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Python
Scikit-learn (Model training & prediction)
Pandas / NumPy
Streamlit (Dashboard UI
Folium + streamlit-folium (Map integration)
Geopy (Nominatim) (Location → Coordinates)

📌 Project Objective

To build a wildfire risk prediction system that uses machine learning and real-time user inputs to estimate wildfire probability and visually assist users through an interactive dashboard.
