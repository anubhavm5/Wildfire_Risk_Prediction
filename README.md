🔥 WildFire Risk Prediction

WildFire Risk Prediction is a Machine Learning based web application that predicts the probability of wildfire risk for a selected location using environmental and weather conditions.
The project includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard with a live map interface where users can select a city/country, view coordinates, enter weather parameters, and instantly get the wildfire risk probability.

This project can help in early wildfire awareness, monitoring risky conditions, and supporting decision-making.

🚀 Features
